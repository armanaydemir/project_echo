UI Flow

Website, single page.

Top: text input box + submit button + private toggle
Below: list of previous logs with timestamps (hidden until you scroll past input)

Logs stored in jsonl file.

That's it for now.

Have it be dark mode with clean/somewhat futuristic text but mainly built for legibility ease of use.
