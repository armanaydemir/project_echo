Concept Document Style

These are internal design notes, not polished docs.

Format
    - plain .txt files
    - title on its own line, blank line, then content
    - short paragraphs, 1-3 sentences max
    - simple indentation with "    - " for nested lists
    - sections separated by blank lines only, no headers

Voice
    - first person, conversational ("I", "we", "you")
    - direct and to the point, no fluff
    - imperfect spelling/grammar is fine
    - acknowledge incompleteness naturally ("That's it for now", "planned")

Content pattern
    - start with what the thing IS (1 sentence)
    - then what it NEEDS (brief list or sentence)
    - then what VIEW/UI is desired (1 sentence)
    - cross-reference other files when relevant ("see activities.txt")

Philosophy
    - everything flows from logs, logs are the only input
    - privacy is a core principle
    - future ideas listed simply as bullets
    - state issues/problems honestly
