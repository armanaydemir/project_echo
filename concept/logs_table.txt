Logs Table Page

A dedicated page for viewing, searching, editing, and managing all logs.

Layout
    - header with navigation back to main page
    - search/filter bar at top (includes tag filter dropdown)
    - table showing timestamp, content, tags, edited indicator, private indicator
    - pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets

Features
    - search logs by text content
    - filter by date range, private/public, edited/unedited, tags
    - sort by timestamp or last edited
    - click row to expand full content if truncated

Tagging (see tags.txt)
    - each row shows tag chips (small colored labels)
    - "needs review" tag highlighted in yellow
    - two action buttons per row: "review" and "+ tag"
    - review button: opens quick-tag modal, auto-removes "needs review" on save
    - "+ tag" button: add tags without full review flow
    - tag chips are clickable to filter by that tag

Editing

Inline edit mode for log content. All edits preserve complete version history - original timestamp never changes, original text always preserved, every edit tracked with when it happened.

Show edit count on edited logs. "View history" option to see all previous versions with timestamps.
    - see logs.txt for more on versioning

Future ideas
    - delete logs (soft delete? keep in history?)
    - export logs (json, csv)
    - bulk selection and actions
    - diff view between versions
