Tags

Tags are labels you attach to logs to organize and categorize them. Inspired by Copilot Money's transaction tagging - flexible, manual at first, smart later.

Every log starts with one tag: "needs review". This is how we know what's been processed and what hasn't. You review a log, decide what tags apply, then remove "needs review".

Tags are freeform text, no hierarchy. A log can have multiple tags. Examples: "work", "health", "idea", "todo", "dog walk", "project-echo".

Storage
    - tags stored as array on each log entry
    - separate tags list tracks all known tags (for autocomplete)
    - see storage_and_deployment.txt

UI in logs table
    - each row shows tag chips next to content
    - "needs review" highlighted differently (yellow?)
    - two buttons per row: "review" and "add tag"
    - review button opens quick-tag modal, removes "needs review" when done
    - filter logs by tag in the filter bar
    - see logs_table.txt

Future ideas
    - auto-suggest tags based on log content (LLM)
    - rules: "logs containing 'walked' auto-tag as 'dog walk'"
    - tag management page (rename, merge, delete tags)
    - tag colors/icons
    - smart tags that update automatically (like "this week")
