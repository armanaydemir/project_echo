Logs

The core of Project Echo. Logs are the single input mechanism - everything else is derived from them.

Need to input from anywhere, as text. Logs are persisted purely, along with their timestamp. All edits to calendars, activities, etc are done through logs. Privacy is key - normal logs vs 'personal' logs with a separate toggle.

Use cases: logging ideas for projects, activities (walking dogs), habits (brushing teeth, smoking), to do items.

Editing and version history

When a log is edited, we keep everything:
    - original timestamp never changes
    - original text is preserved
    - every edit saves the old text with when it was valid
    - current text and when it was last updated

Even if you edit multiple times, we keep every version along the way. Think of it like git history for each log entry.

See logs_table.txt for the editing interface.

Nothing is created from 'personal' logs.
