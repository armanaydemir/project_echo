Project Echo

Our goal is to create a personal assistant/organizor/planner revolving around you, and it all starts with the logs, then we add features that extract from there.

Logs are the single input mechanism - everything else is derived from them.
    - see logs.txt for details on log structure and versioning
    - see logs_table.txt for the logs viewing/editing interface

Issues:
    - logging activities and habits is hard because we have to log every time, we need to add ability to add activities and habits in history, and try to do it automatically as much as possible.


Ideas for future
    - Perhaps everythign else surrouding the log idea, calendar, activities, etc are plugins/modifiers which can be modules to add icloud calendar or whatever you want.
    - push notifications/automatic planning based on log
    - calendar (gantt)
    - ideas/projects/tasks
    - blog based on log
    - habit tracking
    - automatic activity logging based on hooking in apis (git commits, apple exercise for walking dog)
