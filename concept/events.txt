Events are calender events that are of particular interest to me. These can be derived from logs but also can be manually added.

Need a nice view to see the events, in particular a gantt view would be good alongside a traditional calendar.

These should be flexible, can have times or not, can be across dates, contiguous or not, can have location or not, etc.
